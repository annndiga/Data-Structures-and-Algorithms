# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.

This repository contains Python implementations of three functions for various data manipulation tasks.


## Functions
This project includes implementations of the following functions:

- is_balanced: Checks if a given expression with parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced.

- remove_duplicates: Removes duplicate elements from a sequence (list or tuple) while preserving their original order.

- word_frequency: Calculates the frequency of words in a sentence while ignoring punctuation and being case-insensitive.
